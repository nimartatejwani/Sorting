# Sorting [Using Efficient Sorting Algorithms in Java to Arrange Tax Data]

These files are taken from "Using Efficient Sorting Algorithms in Java to Arrange Tax Data" 
a guided project on coursera.org website.
There are sorting algorithms i.e bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge and quick sort.
Algorithms are compared with respect to efficiency.
Project contains 2 classes i.e CountyTax.java and Counties.java 

CountyTax.java: A class which initialize variables tax and county, also contain setter, getter method.
Counties.java: This class contains the method of all algorithms and called in main method.

How to Run:
uncomment any of the method calling in main method of class Counties.java and see it's effeciency.
